## why software engineering?

to build high-quality software systems under resource constraints.

- social: satisfy user needs and impact people's lives
- economical: reduce cost, open up new opportunities
- time to market: deliver software on time

## the software process

the set of activities required to develop a software. what activities need to be completed and in what order, the software life cycle.

common activities:

- specification (software/system requirements)
  - requirements need to be documented, they can be changed also throughout the project
- design and implementation
- validation (testing)
- evolution

## software process models

- software development lifecycles (SDLC)
- describes the software process from different perspective, describes activities and sequence rather than the roles of people

### representative software process models

- **waterfall model**
  - development process activities as process phases
  - linear, sequential approach to SDLC. lots of documentation
- **spiral model**
  - incremental development risk-driven
  - 4 phases for 3 different drafts
- **agile model**
  - iterative incremental process for rapid software development
- **rational unified process**
  - bring together elements of different process models

## waterfall model - heavyweight model
