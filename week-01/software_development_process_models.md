## why software engineering?

to build high-quality software systems under resource constraints.

- social: satisfy user needs and impact people's lives
- economical: reduce cost, open up new opportunities
- time to market: deliver software on time

## the software process

the set of activities required to develop a software. what activities need to be completed and in what order, the software life cycle.

common activities:

- specification (software/system requirements)
  - requirements need to be documented, they can be changed also throughout the project
- design and implementation
- validation (testing)
- evolution

## software process models

- software development lifecycles (SDLC)
- describes the software process from different perspective, describes activities and sequence rather than the roles of people

### representative software process models

- **waterfall model**
  - development process activities as process phases
  - linear, sequential approach to SDLC. lots of documentation
- **spiral model**
  - incremental development risk-driven
  - 4 phases for 3 different drafts
- **agile model**
  - iterative incremental process for rapid software development
- **rational unified process**
  - bring together elements of different process models

## waterfall model - heavyweight model

| development activities                  | teams                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| divide work into stages                 | a separate team of specialists for each stagea      |
| work is passed from one team to another | coordination required for a handoff using documents |
| finished software                       | team assignment to new product                      |

advantages:

- easy to understand and implement
- identified deliverables and milestones

disadvantages:

- intensive documenting and plannign
- discovering issues in later phases leads to returning to earlier phase

### requirements engineering process

the process of identifying, eliciting, analysing, specifing, validating and managing needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

### planning in software development

- plan-driven (plan and document/heavy-weight)
- activities planned in advance and progress measured against this plan
- plan drives everything, don't like change
- agile processes (light weight)
  - planning is incremental and continual as development progresses
  - easier to change to reflect requirements

## rational unified process (RUP or UP)

software development process utilising iterative and risk-driven approach to develop OO software systems.

iterative incremental development. iterative evolutionary development.

## agile development

agile methods intend to develop systems quickly with limited time spent on analysis and design.

agile advocates believe we should move away from the heavy-weightness or cumbersome nature of documentation, and rigidness of SD when it comes to changing requirements. we want more active customer involvement.

agile is considered people based.

based on user stories, in each iteration, elaborate a small set of the functional requirements (the high priority behaviour). create tests at the same time the requirements are written.
